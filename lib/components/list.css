@description
List styles are removed by default so that we can use them semantically in
things like lists of petition cards. However, if you do want a list to look
like a list, you can make use of these list utilities. You simply apply the
classes to the `<ul>` or `<ol>` and they will take on a more traditional form.
In cases where you want all lists inside of a content area to be treated like
lists, you can apply .rte to the parent and all of its children will behave
like bulleted and numbered lists for `<ul>` or `<ol>` respectively.
