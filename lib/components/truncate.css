/*
Truncate

Truncate long blocks of text without requiring any javascript libraries. This
implementation relies on a consistent vertical rhythm in order to maintain an
appropriate overflow since the height of the truncate component is calculated
using the 24 pixel baseline grid.

        Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having
        little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me
        on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part
        of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and
        regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about
        the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever
        I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and
        bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever
        my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
        principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
        methodically knocking people's hats off- then, I account it high time to
        get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.
        With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I
        quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they
        but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish
        very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

Truncate with toggle

Sometimes instead of linking to another page, you may want to expose the
truncated text right there, inline. To do this, you'll need to add some extra
elements: an input to create a switch; and a label for the input that contains
the call to action.

<div class="truncate truncate-5-lines">
  <input class="truncate-toggle" type="checkbox" id="truncate-example" />

        It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when
        Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself, yawned,
        and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy
        feeling in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped
        across her four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the
        mouth of the cave where they all lived. "Augrh!" said Father Wolf.
        "It is time to hunt again." He was going to spring down hill when a
        little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined:
        "Good luck go with you, O Chief of the Wolves. And good luck and
        strong white teeth go with noble children that they may never forget
        the hungry in this world."
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the jackal—Tabaqui, the Dish-licker—and the wolves of India
        despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling
        tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village
        rubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more
        than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets
        that he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting
        everything in his way. Even the tiger runs and hides when little
        Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can
        overtake a wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it
        dewanee—the madness—and run.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Enter, then, and look," said Father Wolf stiffly, "but there is no
        food here."
