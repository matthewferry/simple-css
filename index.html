        Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
        plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
        going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what
        she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
        looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
        cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
        hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
        she passed; it was labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great
        disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
        of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
        she fell past it.

        Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! ‘I wonder how
        many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud. ‘I must be getting
        somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
        thousand miles down, I think--’ (for, you see, Alice had learnt several
        things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
        was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there
        was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)
        ‘--yes, that’s about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
        or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or
        Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
