            Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
            bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
            book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
            it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or
            conversations?’

            So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
            hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
            of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
            picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
            close by her.

            There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
            VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear!
            Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards, it
            occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
            it all seemed quite natural)

        Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
        plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
        going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what
        she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
        looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
        cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
        hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
        she passed; it was labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great
        disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
        of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
        she fell past it.
