        Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry
        your back, it’s a cold world out there.To be successful you’ve got to
        work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. Every chance
        I get, I water the plants, Lion! Eliptical talk. To be successful you’ve
        got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. The
        key to more success is to get a massage once a week, very important,
        major key, cloth talk. The first of the month is coming, we have to get
        money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you
        to eat. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch.
        I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch.
